Hey thereðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my profile!ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ I'm Michelle, and I'm all about building websites. I know my way around HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQL. Basically, I can make stuff look good and work smoothly. Whether it's creating cool designs with HTML and CSS or adding interactive features with JavaScript, I've got you covered. Plus, I'm pretty good at managing data with SQL, so your information stays organized and accessible. Let's team up and make something awesome together!
